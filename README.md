## Project Overview

This project comprises two major tasks:
1. **Digital Transformation Case Study:**  
   An in-depth analysis of a defense companyâ€™s digital readiness, highlighting key pain points, opportunities, and actionable recommendations for transformation.
2. **1B Valuation Growth Strategy:**  
   A financial growth model designed to outline a strategic roadmap to scale the company's valuation from a $100M baseline to $1B within 10 years, incorporating digital investments, process automation, and operational efficiency improvements.

The solution leverages advanced Business Intelligence (BI) techniques, data analytics, and strategic frameworks to deliver clear, data-driven insights for executive decision-makers.
